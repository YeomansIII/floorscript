# Specification Quality Checklist: Smart Dimension Placement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. The spec references existing constants (`LANE_SPACING_FT`) and config fields (`dimensions`) by name in the Assumptions section for context, but these are domain concepts already defined in the project spec — not implementation details.
- The Assumptions section documents four reasonable defaults that were chosen rather than flagging as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION], keeping the spec actionable.
- Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
